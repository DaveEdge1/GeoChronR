# GeoChronR
This is the development repository for GeoChronR.

GeoChronR is being developed as an integrated framework that allows scientists to generate state-of-the-art age models for their records, create time-uncertain ensembles of their data, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize their results in an intuitive way. The code will be developed as a package in the open-source and community-supported R platform.
