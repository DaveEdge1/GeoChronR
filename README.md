## What is it?

Quantifying age uncertainties is a critical component of paleoscience (paleoclimatology, paleoecology, paleontology). GeoChronR is an integrated framework that allows scientists to generate state-of-the-art age models for their records, create time-uncertain ensembles of their data, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize their results in an intuitive way. The code is being developed in the open-source and community-supported R platform. 

GeoChronR is currently under review as a discussion paper in Geochronology, [check it out here](https://doi.org/10.5194/gchron-2020-25)


## Pre-Installation

GeoChronR is a package for R, and so you'll need R to run and install it. GeoChronR should work with any version newer than 3.5.0. You can download R for your operating system [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

You'll also need an interface to use R. Although many can work, I strongly recommend RStudio. You can download RStudio for your operating system [here](https://rstudio.com/).

Once you have R and your interface up and running, you'll need to install some packages. Most of this will be handled automatically, but to get started install the remotes package: 

```
 install.packages("remotes")
```

In addition, the packages are not required, but may be useful, and will not install automatically through geoChronR so if you're interested install lipdR and nuspectral from github:

```
remotes::install_github("nickmckay/lipd-utilities",subdir = "R")
remotes::install_github("nickmckay/nuspectral")
```

## Installation

Install package in R Studio:

```
remotes::install_github("nickmckay/geoChronR")
```

Load the package into the environment:

```
library(geoChronR)
```
