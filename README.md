## What is it?

Quantifying age uncertainties is a critical component of paleoscience (paleoclimatology, paleoecology, paleontology). GeoChronR is an integrated framework that allows scientists to generate state-of-the-art age models for their records, create time-uncertain ensembles of their data, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize their results in an intuitive way. The code is being developed in the open-source and community-supported R platform. 

## Requirements

R - v3.3.1
