11/26/2019 14:35:18,2,10,1,3,2,2,0,0,Track record: How many students has the faculty member graduated in recent years and with how much assistance from the school? New faculty could be exempt. They could be considered to have a good track record in their first 5 years.,"Thank you for doing this. I think it's a great approach. I like the criteria, except I think we need to recognize that, as much as we love our MS programs, we need to be open following the trend toward building the PhD."

You should NOT be required to fund an RA the first year, as the student cannot do much research then, so an RA is not really appropriate.  So, if you want to take two students, but will fund both in their second year, then their cost is the same as one student, so there is no cost to the school.  The only issue is TA allocation."

I know this has been sort of ""settled"", but it still seems to come up each year. Is there a different set of criteria that should apply among the third years? We typically need a few of them."

Overall, I'm a real proponent of equity among faculty. I know with ES&P, it has worked fairly well to more or less give a TA/faculty who wanted it/didn't have other funding that year--it also leads to a diversity of student backgrounds and interests as people working on different topics. That benefits our students as well.

I do like that the current approach allows for tenured, pre-tenure, and lecturers all to have opportunities to advise students. I think it makes us better faculty to work with graduate students and if everyone wants the chance, everyone should be able to have it. 

I also think that instead of giving a TA lines to those that have funding (unless there is no funding for the student tuition) it should go to those without funding for that year, as that will help bring in more students. If there is a funded project without TA funding, then I think that should get bumped up in importance (I struggled with that question for that reason)."

That is, if a student is really exceptional in every way on their application and their prospective faculty member has no funding for them, even if they are not filling a TA or disciplinary gap and even if their prospective faculty member is not ""next in line"" for a TAship, it seems like they should be in the running. That might apply to only one or a couple of applicants per year, of course.",

11/27/2019 14:27:59,0,6,8,8,8,5,9,9,Research active faculty should be prioritized for allocation of TA lines.  This should be based on easily assessed metrics like number of first-author or grad-student led peer-reviewed publications and grant submissions.  Faculty who have not published or submitted a proposal recently should not be prioritized equally.,
